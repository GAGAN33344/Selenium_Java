package ExcelDriven;

/* DataDrivenTesting-- means we can drive the data from excel sheets to java test case.
For doing this, we need Apache POI API Jars.These API's are reliable for transfer the 
data from excel sheet to test cases. It's open source.
if we are working on Maven Project, then we need two dependencies name is -- poi-ooxml
and poi, these dependencies are mandatory for driving the data from excel file to test
cases. we will place these dependencies in POM.xml file. 
First I will create XSSFWorkbook class and create the object of that class, that object
will take over the control of excel sheet because this class have lots of method to pull
the data from excel sheet.
for example we have lots of sheet in one excel, so now we will access that sheet, which
one is required.
After that i will access the all the rows of sheet.
After that i will access to specific row from all the rows.
After that i will access all the columns of that particular row.
After that i will get the data and store into array.
