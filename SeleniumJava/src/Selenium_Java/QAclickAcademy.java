/* 1.in this test case, i will count the how many links are present on webpage
 * Links always start from anchor tag a.
 * with the assistance of anchor tag we can count links using tagName Locator.
 * 2. how we can count total link which are present in footer section. 
 * For doing this, First i have to create subset driver of main driver for footer section, then the 
   scope of Subset driver will only on footer section, after that we can access links on
   footer section. Because global driver object scope is on whole webpage.
 * why we can say limiting WebDriver scope, because WebDriver can't directly access
   the footer section. 
   3. In 2nd case we count total links in footer section there are four columns,
    but now i want to count only on first column links in footer section. so we have to
    create one more subset driver. 
   4. Click on each Column link and check page is open or not.sometime links are dynamic
   --means today in first footer column links are 5, tomorrow it will be 6,10 or many more
   so in this condition, i will not find each link locator and click on it, in this
   scenario first i will count how any links are present under this first column and click 
   on it one by one.then my test will not fail.
   Now I want to navigate to open tabs and get the title.
