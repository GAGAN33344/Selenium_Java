/*TestNG is one of the most important component when we start developing the framework
from scratch level because we have the control on all test cases and their execution 
with the help of testNG, thats why we can say it's a testing framework.
*With the help of testNG, we can run all the test cases in single shot. 
*We can set, map and control the test cases with the help of Annotations in testNG.
*We can also pick particular test cases from all test cases like we need some test cases
which are related to regression testing, then we can group them.
*In testNG, XML file plays a important role to execute the test cases.
*we can do parameterization, run one test case with multiple set of data also
we can drive the data from external resources.
*In class, our test will run on java compiler because of Public Static Void Main(), now 
if we have testNG plug-in or import testNG libraries in our project, then we don't 
need to depend on java compiler because teatNG itself act as java compiler and execute 
all our test cases. it's not mean, we don't need java, testNG also depends upon on
java from backend.
*TestNG needs all it test cases execution in a method.
